This is an easy problem to understand the essence of Analysis and Regression Algorithms.
Although, if you don't have much knowledge about Moneyball, it can be a bit difficult for you to get the logic out of it but the code here will surely help.

I've used Logistic-Regression here because it is one of the most suitable algorithms when the data in the dependent variable is binary (i.e '0' or '1'). Rest the explination is mentioned in notebook.

More modifications will done in future to!
